  Split out of kotoba.lang.test on 2026-09-09 (ADR-2609091200). The unit
  here is the DEFINITION, and this repo's deps.edn names exactly the
  definitions it reaches -- nothing else.

  "Run deftest-registered tests (see `run-tests-report` for the args and
  the returned map's shape).

  Exit-code side effect: on nbb (`:cljs`), calls `(js/process.exit 1)` when
  `(+ fail error)` is positive, matching this repo's own `run-tests.cljs`
  idiom (a suite that fails while exiting 0 is worse than one that never
  ran). On `:clj`, no process exit is performed here — the returned map is
  the contract; a JVM caller that needs a shell exit code inspects it (see
  this repo's own `deps.edn` `:test` alias, which uses
  `cognitect.test-runner` against the OTHER (`clojure.test`-based) test
  suite for that — this library does not shell out on its own behalf)."
