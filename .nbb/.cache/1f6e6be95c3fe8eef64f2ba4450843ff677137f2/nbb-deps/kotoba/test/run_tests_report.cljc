  Split out of kotoba.lang.test on 2026-09-09 (ADR-2609091200). The unit
  here is the DEFINITION, and this repo's deps.edn names exactly the
  definitions it reaches -- nothing else.

(defn run-tests-report
  "Run deftest-registered tests and return the result map — same as
  `run-tests` but NEVER calls `js/process.exit`, regardless of outcome.

  With no args, runs every test in the global registry; with one or more
  namespace symbols, runs only tests registered under those namespaces (in
  the order registered).

  Prints per-failure/-error detail as it goes, then a summary line, then
  returns `{:test :pass :fail :error :assertions :details}` —
  `:assertions` is `(+ pass fail error)`, `:details` a vector of the
  fail/error records (each with :test :type :form :context and either
  :expected/:actual or :exception/:note).

  `run-tests` is the public entry point most callers want (it adds the
  exit-on-failure side effect on `:cljs`). This function exists so a
  caller can inspect a run's result map in-process without the process
  exiting out from under it — which is exactly what this library's own
  self-verification harness needs
  (test/kotoba/lang/test/selftest_run.cljc): it runs a suite that is
  DELIBERATELY full of planted failures and must compare the resulting
  counts against what it planted, in the same process, before deciding
  anything itself."
