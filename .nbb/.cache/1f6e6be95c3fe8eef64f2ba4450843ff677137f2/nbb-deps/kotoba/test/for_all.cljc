(defn for-all
  "Declarative property: `bindings` is [name gen-fn]*, `body` is the property
  expression (the last value is truthy on pass). Returns a fn of one generated
  tuple, suitable to pass to quickcheck with a tuple generator.

  NOTE: for the M1 surface this is a thin wrapper that builds a single-value
  property from the first binding; multi-var for-all lands with composite
  generators."
