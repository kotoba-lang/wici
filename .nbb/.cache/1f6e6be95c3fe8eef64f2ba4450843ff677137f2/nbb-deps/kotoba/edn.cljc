(ns kotoba.edn
  "Assembled from one repo per definition.

  This namespace holds no implementation. It re-exports the definitions
  that each live in their own repo, so a call site can require one name
  and a library can require only the definitions it actually uses.

  Value vars are not re-exported either: literal-controls, max-depth, max-edn-bytes, max-exact-integer, max-nodes, max-string-chars, max-token-chars, named-chars, option-keys. `(def x other/x)` copies, which is harmless for a function and makes
  with-redefs through this namespace a SILENT no-op for a value -- measured
  on kotoba.lang.edn, where three assertions passed against nothing at all.
  Require the repo that defines the value.
