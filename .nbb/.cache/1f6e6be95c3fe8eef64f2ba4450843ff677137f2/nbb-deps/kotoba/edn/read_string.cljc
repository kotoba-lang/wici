(defn read-string
  "Read the single EDN form in `text`.

  With one argument nothing is optional and nothing is tagged: reader
  evaluation and tagged literals are forbidden, and input holding no form is
  refused. That is the strict default and it has not changed.

  With an options map first -- `clojure.edn/read-string`'s argument order --
  three things can be relaxed, each only by naming it:

    :readers  {tag-symbol (fn [value] ...)}  handlers for specific tags
    :default  (fn [tag value] ...)           handler for any other tag
    :eof      value                          returned when there is no form

  A tagged literal is admitted by the LEXER only when `:readers` or `:default`
  is present, so the strict default cannot be widened by accident, and a tag
  with no handler is still refused even when other tags have one.

  `:eof` exists because the two host readers disagree about it and neither says
  so. Measured 2026-09-08: `(clojure.edn/read-string {:eof s} \"\")` answers the
  sentinel on the JVM and `nil` on ClojureScript -- but for whitespace-only and
  comment-only input BOTH answer the sentinel. So the divergence is not \"cljs
  ignores :eof\" (which is what the one call site in this workspace had
  recorded); it is the empty string alone. Here all three answer the sentinel.

  An option key that is not one of those three is refused, not ignored."
